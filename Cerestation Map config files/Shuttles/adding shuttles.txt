go to the code\datums\shuttles.dmm
once there use the following

copy and paste from a different shuttle that serves the same purpose

example syntax:


/datum/map_template/shuttle/(type of shuttle)/(suffix of station)
	suffix = "name" (this is the suffix of the .dmm shuttle i.e so cargo_cere would be just "cere"
	name = "any name"
