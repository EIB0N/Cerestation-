-go to the code\datums\shuttles.dmm

-copy and paste from a different shuttle that serves the same purpose

-keep in mind the centcom port also has to be able to hold the shuttle
 so change the dimension for that to accomodate for your shuttle

	example syntax:

	/datum/map_template/shuttle/(type of shuttle)/(suffix of station)
		suffix = "name" (this is the suffix of the .dmm shuttle i.e so cargo_cere would be just "cere"
		name = "any name"
